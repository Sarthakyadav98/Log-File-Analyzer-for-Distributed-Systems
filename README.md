# 🧠 Parallel Log File Analyzer for Distributed Systems

## 📍 Overview
This project implements a **Parallel Log File Analyzer** using **C++** and **OpenMP** to efficiently process and analyze large log files generated by distributed systems.  
It provides **serial and parallel implementations**, measures **performance speedup**, and analyzes **system logs** to extract valuable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Efficiently process large log files generated by servers or distributed systems.  
- Extract meaningful insights:
  - Frequency of important keywords (`ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`)
  - Most frequent IPs/users
  - Trends of errors across time windows
- Compare **serial vs. parallel** performance using OpenMP.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Supports **multiple log files**  
✅ Counts keyword frequencies  
✅ Detects **top N frequent IPs**  
✅ Identifies **top N recurring error messages**  
✅ Tracks **error trends over time**  
✅ Benchmarks and compares **serial vs. parallel performance**
