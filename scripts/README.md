# Benchmark and Visualization Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts for benchmarking and visualizing the performance of serial vs parallel log analysis.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `run_all_benchmarks.py` (Master Script)
**Purpose:** Complete automation of the benchmarking process
- Generates log files of different sizes
- Builds and runs benchmarks
- Generates all visualization graphs

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/run_all_benchmarks.py
```

### 2. `plot_performance.py`
**Purpose:** Plot performance comparison between Serial and Parallel implementations
- Shows execution time vs number of log lines
- Log-log scale for better visualization of large datasets

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/plot_performance.py
```

**Output:** `results/serial_vs_parallel.png`

### 3. `plot_speedup.py`
**Purpose:** Analyze and visualize speedup achieved by parallelization
- Shows measured speedup vs ideal speedup
- Helps identify overhead and parallelization effectiveness

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/plot_speedup.py
```

**Output:** `results/speedup_analysis.png`

### 4. `plot_efficiency.py`
**Purpose:** Visualize parallel efficiency
- Shows how efficiently CPU cores are being utilized
- Helps identify scalability issues

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/plot_efficiency.py
```

**Output:** `results/efficiency_analysis.png`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages (install with `pip install`):
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

## Quick Start

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

2. Run the master script:
```bash
python3 scripts/run_all_benchmarks.py
```

3. View the generated graphs in the `results/` directory

## Data Files

The benchmark uses log files of increasing sizes:
- `log1.txt`, `log2.txt` - Small (5-6 lines)
- `log_small.txt` - 100 lines
- `log_medium.txt` - 1,000 lines
- `log_large.txt` - 10,000 lines
- `log_xlarge.txt` - 50,000 lines
- `log_xxlarge.txt` - 100,000 lines

These files are automatically generated by `data/log_generator.py`

## Output

All graphs and CSV data are saved in the `results/` directory:
- `benchmark_data.csv` - Raw benchmark data
- `serial_vs_parallel.png` - Performance comparison graph
- `speedup_analysis.png` - Speedup analysis graph
- `efficiency_analysis.png` - Efficiency analysis graph
